    twist, wouldn't you say?"
  - But look on the bright side, your final adversary has transformed into something
    far less daunting, perhaps even adorable.
  - It's a gentle reminder that sometimes, things aren't as scary as they seem, and
    a little laughter can turn the tide of any battle.
  - So, take a moment, catch your breath, and when you're ready, embrace the finale
    with a smile.
